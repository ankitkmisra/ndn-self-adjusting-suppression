### What is Mini-NDN?

Mini-NDN is a lightweight networking emulation tool that enables testing, experimentation, and
research on the NDN platform based on [Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet).
Mini-NDN uses the NDN libraries, NFD, NLSR, and tools released by the
[NDN project](https://named-data.net/codebase/platform/) to emulate an NDN network on a single system.
